# Welcome To Squeryl

Squeryl is a Slackbot for SEOs. It's designed to help you get the most out of your SEO tools, and to help you get the most out of your data and help point you to problems-- and solutions.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to add Squeryl to your Slack workspace. For Alpha testers, you will need to request an invite. 

## What can Squeryl do?

Squeryl can do a lot of things! Squeryl is a tool that interacts and interfaces with other SEO tools, as well as your own data. This means you can access data all in the same location, and you can use Squeryl to help you get the most out of your tools.

Current tools include:

- [GSC Ngrams](/gsc-ngrams/)


## Intergrations

Squeryl is designed to work with other tools. Currently, Squeryl can work with the following tools:

* Google Search Console
* Google Analytics
* Google BigQuery
* Google Sheets

We're working on adding more tools, and we're always open to suggestions!

## What's next?

Squeryl is still in Alpha, and we're working on adding more features and tools. We're also working on adding more documentation, and are open to suggestions from the community. You can get involved using our contact form or by voting on our [roadmap.](/roadmap/index.html)
