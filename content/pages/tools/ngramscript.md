Ngrams are a way to cluster data-- in this case, search queries-- into groups. This is useful for identifying trends and patterns in search queries.

## What it does

Runs an ngram analysis on the uploaded text. Ngrams are a sequence of items from a given sample text or speech (see below: six n-grams found in titles of publications about Coronavirus in 2019, as an example.)

## What it needs

GSC access or some sort of text.

## How to use it

You can select URLs or keywords. For URLs, it will split the URLs and group them with GSC information attached, same with keywords. This can let you understand what kinds of words get the most and least traffic on a site.

### Workflow

1. Upload a text file with the text you want to run the ngram analysis on or simply select a GSC account.
2. Wait for the analysis to complete.
3. Download the results.


### Use cases

- Understanding what kinds of words get the most and least traffic on a site.
- Understanding what kinds of words are most commonly used in a site's content.
- Understanding what Google is looking for in a site's content.



### Use with other tools

Ngrams can be used with other tools to understand what kinds of words are most commonly used in a site's content. This can be used to inform content strategy. You can also see if there was a drop or rise in traffic for a particular type of content.
