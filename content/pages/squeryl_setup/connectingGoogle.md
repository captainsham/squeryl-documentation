### Squeryl Config - Connecting Google

One of the first tasks to do to get Squeryl up and running is to connect a Google Search Console account. Do this by going to the App home screen.

On the home page you can see any Google accounts that have already been created, as well as adding new accounts.

Simply click “Connect with Google” and log in normally.

Now Squeryl can access Google, but we want to make sure that there is still a partition. Some agencies have multiple clients who might compete with each other, so Squeryl only connects the Google account to a channel when that Google account is configured to that channel. We’ll go over that in the next step.
