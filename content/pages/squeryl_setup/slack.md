### Slack terminology

Slack has a couple of terms that you should be familiar with before you start using Squeryl. 

-- Workspace: A workspace is a collection of channels and users. You can have multiple workspaces, but you can only be in one at a time.

-- Slack apps: Slack apps are third-party integrations that you can add to your workspace. Squeryl is a Slack app.
-- App home: The app home is the place where you can see a few different things. You can connect Google Accounts for use with Squeryl tools, configure and manage the app (including authorizations), and see the latest news from Squeryl.
