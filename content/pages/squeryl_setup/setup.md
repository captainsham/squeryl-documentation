# Setting up Squeryl

Squeryl is currently only available in Slack as a bot. There are a couple of advantages to this: you can link accounts to different clients, share data between coworkers, and it's easier to manage.

 You can get access to Squeryl by adding the tool to a slack workspace – ask your workspace administrator.

### Adding Squeryl to Slack:

You can add Squeryl to Slack by configuring it through the App marketplace. Once Squeryl has been added to a slack channel/account, you can summon it by using the @ command, and add it to a channel as an individual user.


### Basic Squeryl commands and functions:

There are a number of commands that you can use with Squeryl, but the most common one is the ‘tools’ command, which gives you a list of tools you can run using Squeryl.

You can also use the ‘help’ command to get a list of commands and functions that you can use with Squeryl.

You will also need to use the configure command to set up connections to Search Console and other analytics accounts.
